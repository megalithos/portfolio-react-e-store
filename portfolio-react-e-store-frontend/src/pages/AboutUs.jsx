            <p>Welcome to our website, a project created as part of my portfolio to showcase my skills and expertise in web development. My name is Akseli, and I am the developer behind this project.

        This website was built from scratch, both on the frontend and backend, to provide a seamless user experience. I utilized modern technologies and frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL to build a high-performance and feature-rich web application.

        The frontend of the website is built using React and Bootstrap, providing a clean and intuitive user interface that is optimized for desktop and mobile devices. The backend is built on NodeJS, using the latest industry-standard practices to ensure stability, security, and performance. The database is powered by PostgreSQL, providing a robust and scalable solution for data storage and management.

        My goal with this project was to create a website that not only showcases my skills and knowledge but also provides an enjoyable and efficient experience for our customers. If you have any questions or feedback about the website, please don't hesitate to contact me.

        Thank you for visiting our website, and I hope you enjoy your experience here.</p>
